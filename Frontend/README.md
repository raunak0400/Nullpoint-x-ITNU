## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (v18 or later recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js)

### Environment Variables

Before you can run the application, you need to set up your environment variables. Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project and add your API keys.

```
# .env

# Your Google Maps API key for map rendering and heatmaps.
# This key needs to have Maps JavaScript API enabled.
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key_here

# Your Gemini API key for using the AI-powered features (Smart Tips, Predictions).
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already):
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <project-directory>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Development Server

Once the dependencies are installed and your environment variables are set, you can start the development server.

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002).

## üìÇ Project Structure
